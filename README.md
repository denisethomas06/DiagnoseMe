DiagnoseMe â€“ A Symptom Based Diagnosis Assistant
A user-friendly web application created to help people gain a clearer understanding of their health. It doesn't replace the need for medical professionals, but rather functions as an educational tool. It enables users to input their symptoms, providing them with potential health condition suggestions based on those symptoms. This empowers users to engage in more informed discussions with healthcare providers.
